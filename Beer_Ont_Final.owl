Color: Varies with underlying style
Clarity: Varies with underlying style
Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with underlying style
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with underlying style
Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying style
Fermentation Characteristics: Aged Beers are any beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with various aging conditions for an extended time. In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma and flavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol.
Body: Varies with underlying style
Additional notes: Within the framework of these guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers which then undergo aging of one or more years in glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory outcomes of that additional aging, may be categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers, Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of aging in the presence of any microflora must be categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone aging but which nonetheless do not display characteristics of aging are categorized within their base styles.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of vessel, duration of aging process, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Originally from the DÃ¼sseldorf area of Germany, the German-Style Brown/Altbier strikes a balance between hop and malt flavors
and aromas, but can have low fruity esters and some peppery and floral hop aromas. Before Germany had lager beer, it had ales.
Alt, meaning âold,â pays homage to one rebel region in Germany which did not lean into lagering. U.S. producers celebrate the ale
revolution beautifully with this top-fermented German beer style.

The American amber ale is one of the most widely enjoyed styles throughout the United States and serves as a cornerstone style of
the American craft brewing revolution. American ambers are darker in color than their pale ale cousins, the presence of caramel
and crystal malts lending a toasted, toffee flavor, along with the perception of a fuller body when compared to beers without such
malts. Amber beer showcases a medium-high to high malt character with medium to low caramel character derived from the use of
roasted crystal malts. The American amber is characterized by American-variety hops, which lend the amber ale notes of citrus,
fruit and pine to balance the sweetness of the malt.

Within the framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison and/or Brettanomyces) should be categorized as Belgian-Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity flavor and/or aroma could be categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy should be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. Fruit Beers brewed with wheat should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be categorized as Fruit Beers. All of the various India Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed as Fruit Beers are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. All fruited Sour Beers are categorized elsewhere. All fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged beers whether sour or not are categorized elsewhere. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be categorized as Field Beers.

Fruit or fruit extracts, used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood-derived aromas and flavors such as vanillin should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood should be categorized in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit Brettanomyces may be categorized in this style when no other category exists for such beers. However, a fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character should be categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style fruit beer should be categorized as a Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-Style beers brewed with additional adjuncts could fall in this category or perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers fermented with German, British or American ale or lager yeast should be categorized as American-Style Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

It is a regional variation of the wheat beer style from Northern Germany, dating back to at least the 16th century. It can be made from combinations of malted barley and wheat, with the stipulation that the malts are kilned at very low temperatures to minimise colour formation. The fermentation takes place with a mixture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria, a prerequisite that creates the lactic acid taste, a distinguishing feature of Berliner Weisse. (Wikipedia)</Literal>

Low in alcohol, refreshingly tart, and often served with a flavored syrup like Woodruff or raspberry, the Berliner-style Weisse
presents a harmony between yeast and lactic acid. These beers are very pale in color, and may be cloudy as they are often
unfiltered. Hops are not a feature of this style, but these beers often do showcase esters. Traditional versions often showcase
Brettanomyces yeast. Growing in popularity in the U.S., where many brewers are now adding traditional and exotic fruits to the
recipe, resulting in flavorful finishes with striking, colorful hues. These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and
residual sugar are very low, allowing the beerâs acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine. Carbonation is very
high, adding to the refreshment factor this style delivers. Many examples of this style contain no hops and thus no bitterness at all.

        <IRI>#Bidere_de_Garde</IRI>
        <Literal>BiÃ¨re de Garde (&quot;beer for keeping&quot;) is a strong pale ale or keeping beer traditionally brewed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. These beers were originally brewed in farmhouses (they are known as Farmhouse ales) during the winter and spring, to avoid unpredictable problems with the yeast during the summertime. Farmhouse production is now supplemented by commercial production, although most BiÃ¨re de Garde brewers are small businesses.

Typically, beers of this tradition are of a copper colour or golden colour, and as the name suggests the origins of this style lies in the tradition that it was matured or cellared for a period of time once bottled (and most sealed with a cork), to be consumed later in the year, akin to a Belgian Saison.

Most varieties are top-fermented and unfiltered, although bottom-fermented and filtered versions exist.

The Belgian-style blonde ale is typically easy-drinking, with a low but pleasing hop bitterness. This is a light- to medium-bodied
ale, with a low malt aroma that has a spiced and sometimes fruity-ester character. Sugar is sometimes added to lighten the
perceived body. This style is medium in sweetness and not as bitter as Belgian-style tripels or golden strong ales. It is usually
brilliantly clear. The overall impression is balance between light sweetness, spice and low to medium fruity ester flavors.

Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.

English-style brown ales have two variations: a dry, roasted version that is said to have originated from northern England, and a
sweeter, less attenuated brown ale variety that is believed to have gained favor in the southern portion of England. Both offer a
toasted nut, chocolatey character indicative of brown ales. The English brown ale varieties will not be as hoppy or bitter as their
American counterparts and favor English hops as well as characterful English ale yeast. Either style can be excellent with a variety
of foods, particularly braised meats, but they are perfectly fine to be enjoyed on their own. The alcohol content of this beer is
characteristically moderate and does not typically exceed 5.5 percent ABV.

        <Literal>Cream ale is a style of American beer which is light in color and is well attenuated. While cream ales are top-fermented ales, they typically undergo an extended period of cold-conditioning or lagering after primary fermentation is complete. This reduces fruity esters and gives the beer a cleaner flavor. Some examples also have a lager yeast added for the cold-conditioning stage or are mixtures of ales and lagers. Adjuncts such as corn and rice are used to lighten the body and flavor, although all-malt examples are available from many craft brewers.

Milk sugar (lactose) lends the style more body. This beer does use lactose sugar, so people with an intolerance should probably
avoid this style.

        <IRI>#Dunkel</IRI>
        <Literal>Dunkel, or Dunkles, is a word used for several types of dark German lager. Dunkel is the German word meaning dark, and dunkel beers typically range in color from amber to dark reddish brown. They are characterized by their smooth malty flavor. In informal terms, such as when ordering at a bar, &quot;dunkel&quot; is likely to mean whatever dark beer the bar has on tap, or sells most of; in much of north and western Germany, especially near DÃ¼sseldorf, this may be Altbier.

In Bavaria, Dunkel, along with helles, is a traditional style brewed in Munich and popular throughout Bavaria. With alcohol concentrations of 4.5% to 6% by volume, dunkels are weaker than Doppelbocks, another traditional dark Bavarian beer. Dunkels are produced using Munich malts which give the Dunkel its color. Other malts or flavors may also be added.

        <IRI>#Flanders_Red_Ale</IRI>
        <Literal>Flanders red ale or Flemish red-brown, is a style of sour ale brewed in West Flanders, Belgium.

Flanders red ale is fermented with organisms other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially Lactobacillus, which produces a sour character attributable to lactic acid. Long periods of aging are employed, a year or more, often in oak barrels, to impart a lactic acid character to the beer. Red malt is used to give the beer its colour and the matured beer is often blended with a younger batch before bottling to balance and round the character.

Flanders red ales have a strong fruit flavour similar to the aroma, but more intense. Plum, prune, raisin and raspberry are the most common flavours, followed by orange and some spiciness. The sour or acidic taste can range from moderate to strong. There is no hop bitterness, but tannins are common. Consequently, Flanders red ales are often described as the most wine-like of all beers.

Additional notes: These ales or lagers are brewed with freshly harvested hops. Such hops might be undried fresh or frozen cones or ground material, or, freshly kilned dried cones or pellets.

Additional notes: These beers, also known by the names Framboise, Kriek, Peche, Cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit aromas and flavors. Fruit Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Fruit Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be &quot;Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics.&quot; The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit, or other sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars, or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information. Such beers exhibiting wood-derived attributes should be categorized in other Wood-Aged categories.

Fermentation Characteristics: Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS and Brettanomyces should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. There should be no residual flavors from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin should not be present.
Body: Low to high
Additional notes: Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense.

        <IRI>#Gose</IRI>
        <Literal>Gose (/É¡oÊzÉ/) is a warm fermented beer that originated in Goslar, Germany. It is usually brewed with at least 50% of the grain bill being malted wheat. Dominant flavours in gose include a lemon sourness, a herbal characteristic, and a strong saltiness (the result of either local water sources or added salt). Gose beers typically do not have prominent hop bitterness, flavours, or aroma. The beers typically have a moderate alcohol content of 4 to 5% ABV.

Because of the use of coriander and salt, gose does not comply with the Reinheitsgebot â it is allowed an exemption on the grounds of being a regional specialty. It acquires its characteristic sourness through inoculation with lactobacillus bacteria.

Gose belongs to the same family of sour wheat beers which were once brewed across Northern Germany and the Low Countries. Other beers of this family are Belgian Witbier, Berliner Weisse, and Broyhan.

Belgian-style Lambic or Gueueze beers are naturally and spontaneously fermented with high to very high levels of esters, plus
bacterial and yeast-derived sourness that sometimes includes acetic flavors. Lambics are not blended, while the gueuze style
blends old and new lambics which are re-fermented in the bottle. Historically, they are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting
no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through the addition of
sugars or artificial sweeteners. Many examples of this style are made to resemble the gueuze lambic beers of the Brussels area,
where it originated.

Hop Aroma/Flavor Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness are not perceived to very low, and can include
cheesy or floral lavender notes

        <IRI>#Gueuze</IRI>
        <Literal>Gueuze (Dutch geuze, pronounced [ËÉ£Ã¸zÉ]; French gueuze, [É¡Ã¸z]) is a type of lambic, a Belgian beer. It is made by blending young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur.

Since gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and &quot;barnyard-like&quot;. Because of its carbonation, gueuze is sometimes called &quot;Brussels Champagne&quot;.

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Sweet malt character is not present
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very low and can include cheesy, floral or lavender-like attributes.
Perceived bitterness: Very low
Fermentation Characteristics: Gueuze represents blends of aged and newly fermenting young Lambics. These unflavored blended and secondary fermented beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. They are characterized by intense fruity ester, sour, and acidic attributes which only result from spontaneous fermentation. Diacetyl should not be present. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be present. Carbonation can be none (flat) to medium.
Body: Very low with dry mouthfeel
Additional notes: Gueuze originating in the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Gueuze. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be &quot;Belgian-Style Gueuze.&quot; The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Gueuze is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Gueuze is brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops.

Perceived bitterness: Low to medium. The impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels.
Fermentation Characteristics: Medium to medium-high fruity esters are present, and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Diacetyl should not be present.
Body: Medium-low to medium-high. A silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.
Additional notes: Grist may include oats, wheat, or other adjuncts to promote haziness. Lactose may be used to enhance body and balance. Lactose should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. The term &quot;juicy&quot; is frequently used to describe flavor and aroma attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Other hop-derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non-traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to create subcategories which reflect the use of colored malts and associated hue and aroma and flavor attributes, or based on types of hops used.

The German-style hefeweizen is straw to amber in color and brewed with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The aroma and flavor
of a weissbier comes largely from the yeast and is decidedly fruity (banana) and phenolic (clove). The intensity of these wildly
differing flavor qualities varies depending on the brewer, but the two are most commonly balanced. Hefeweizen typically contains
a low to moderate alcohol content and is considered to be the most popular amongst the German weissbier variety.

        <Literal>The Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 IBUs) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer&apos;s relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavor note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is 4-vinyl guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. Hefeweizen&apos;s phenolic character has been described as &quot;clove&quot; and &quot;medicinal&quot; (&quot;Band-aid&quot;) but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by WeiÃbier yeast include &quot;banana&quot; (amyl acetate), &quot;bubble gum&quot;, and sometimes &quot;vanilla&quot; (vanillin).

German hop flavor and light bitterness. The malt character is soft and bready, making it a terrific complement to light dishes such
as salad or fresh shellfish, like clams. Clean and crisp, this is a refreshing beer with substance. Low levels of yeast-produced sulfur
aromas and flavors may be common.

        <IRI>#Helles</IRI>
        <Literal>Helles or hell is a traditional German pale lager beer, produced chiefly in Southern Germany, particularly Munich. The German word hell can be translated as &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, or &quot;pale&quot;.

Helles-style beers typically are full-bodied, mildly sweet and light-coloured, with low bitterness. The beer is clear due to filtration prior to bottling, although some restaurants and breweries do offer an unfiltered version. Munich-style helles is a yellow beer brewed using cool fermentation with a lager yeast such as Saccharomyces pastorianus, bitter hops such as Hallertau hops, and an original specific gravity (prior to fermentation) between 1.044 and 1.053 (11 to 13 degrees plato), and between 4.5 and 6% alcohol by volume. Helles has a less-pronounced hop flavour than pilsner beers.

        <Literal>American IPA

Characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney or resinous American-variety hop character, the IPA beer style is all about hop
flavor, aroma and bitterness. This has been the most-entered category at the Great American Beer Festival for more than a decade,
and is the top-selling craft beer style in supermarkets and liquor stores across the U.S.

        <IRI>#India_Pale_Ale</IRI>
        <Literal>English-Style IPA

Steeped in lore (and extra hops), the English-style IPA is a stronger version of a pale ale. The English-style pale ale is characterized
by a hearty helping of English hop character (earthy, floral) and increased alcohol content. English yeast lend a fruity character to
the flavor and aroma, offering a contrast to the earthy English hop additions. Different from its American counterpart, this style
strikes a balance between malt and hops for a more rounded flavor.
There is also a lot of mythology surrounding the creation of this style, which is still debated today. It is most commonly believed
that English style pale ale was birthed from the need for a beer that could survive the journey to and from India, a land too warm
for beer brewing without the aid of modern technology. The increased alcohol and hop contents would act as preservatives, giving
IPAs the qualities that they are known for to this day. In actuality, the beer style that would become popularly known as an India
pale ale bears little in common with the contemporary iteration you enjoy today. Additionally, beers similar to what made the trip
to India had been in production for domestic consumption prior to any reports of it being exported and records show that other
beer styles, including porter, made their way to the English colony of India and were enjoyed by parched soldiers and colonists.
English pale ale beers, like the IPA, always offer great beer pairing opportunities. Strong English cheeses as well as grilled or
braised meats, like pork, can make very tasty flavor experiences when paired with an English IPA. The higher alcohol, hops and
carbonation all work to cut through fat and cleanse the palate, helping every bite be as tasty as the first.

Emphasizing hop aroma and flavor without bracing bitterness, the New England IPA  leans heavily on late and dry hopping
techniques to deliver a bursting juicy, tropical hop experience. The skillful balance of technique and ingredient selection, often
including the addition of wheat or oats, lends an alluring haze to this popular take on the American IPA.

Color: Varies depending on the underlying European origin lager or ale style
Clarity: Typically slightly hazy to moderately cloudy, but may become clear through settling. A small amount of yeast haze is acceptable and traditional.
Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending on the underlying style
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending on underlying style. Low level attributes typical of late or dry hopping may be present in some versions.
Perceived bitterness: Varies depending on underlying style
Fermentation Characteristics: Low levels of sulfur and acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation, if present, can enhance the flavor of these beers. Low fruity esters may be present and may vary slightly from the underlying style due to age and the presence of yeast. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at low levels in keller versions of beer styles which can contain diacetyl when fully aged, such as Bohemian-Style Lager.
Body: Varies depending on underlying style
Additional notes: Kellerbier or Zwickelbiers are unfiltered versions of lager or ale styles of European origin. These can include traditional Helles, Dunkel, Dortmunder, Vienna, Rotbier, Bohemian, Koelsch, Alt, as well as less common traditional or contemporary European-origin lager and ale styles. Kellerbiers have carbonation ranging from low to normal and may exhibit poor head retention. These beers are typically unfiltered, but they may be filtered and then redosed with yeast. Whether filtered or unfiltered these beers are packaged and served with very low to moderate amounts of yeast.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should include the underlying European-origin lager or ale style upon which the entry is based. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on ale or lager yeast type or hue.

Additional notes: This American-born regional style proliferated around Louisville, Kentucky, from the Civil War era until Prohibition. Corn grits or flakes were commonly used at a rate or 25-35% of the total grist. Minerally attributes resulted from the use of hard brewing water. These beers were consumed very young, going from brewhouse to consumer in as little as one week. Early 20th century brewing literature mentions a slight tartness developing during fermentation as a characteristic attribute of this style. If tartness is present in modern versions, it should be at very low levels.

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Sweet malt character should not be present
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very low, and can include cheesy or floral lavender-like attributes. Hop character is achieved by using stale and aged hops at low rates.
Perceived bitterness: Very low
Fermentation Characteristics: Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. High to very high fruity esters are present. Traditionally, Lambics are unblended and spontaneously fermented. They express high to very high levels of fruity esters as well as bacteria and yeast-derived sourness. Some versions are fermented with the addition of cultured yeast and bacteria. Carbonation can range from very low to high. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be present.
Body: Very low with dry mouthfeel
Additional notes: Lambics originating in the Brussels area of Belgium are often simply called Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area cannot be called true Lambics. These versions are said to be &quot;Belgian-Style Lambic&quot; and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through the addition of sugars or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Lambics are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley.

Types of lambic beers include gueuze, kriek lambic and framboise. Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer&apos;s yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, often with a tart aftertaste.

In common usage, it refers to beers containing a high alcohol content, generally above 6%, which are made with ingredients and processes resembling those for American-style lagers.

Malt liquor is a strong lager or ale in which sugar, corn or other adjuncts are added to the malted barley to boost the total amount of fermentable sugars in the wort. This gives a boost to the final alcohol concentration without creating a heavier or sweeter taste. Also, they are not heavily hopped, thus they are not very bitter.

A distinctive quality of these ales is that their yeast undergoes an aging process (often for years) in bulk storage or through bottle
conditioning, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Old ales are copper-red to very dark in
color. Complex estery character may emerge.

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to medium
Perceived bitterness: Present but minimal
Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters can contribute to the character of these beers. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process, often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle. This contributes to a rich, wine-like, and often sweet, oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may also emerge. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels.
Body: Medium to full
Additional notes: Low level attributes typical of wood aging such as vanilla are acceptable. Brettanomyces and acidity reflect historical character; low level attributes such as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, etc. and acidity may be present and balanced with other flavors. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as bourbon or sherry, should not be present.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to split this category into subcategories which reflect strong and very strong versions, or historic and modern versions.

The Dutch name refers to the long aging process, up to a year. It undergoes a secondary fermentation, which takes several weeks to a month, and is followed by bottle aging for several more months. The extended aging allows residual yeast and bacteria to develop a sour flavor characteristic for this style. Usually, cultured yeast and bacterias are used, as stainless steel equipment does not harbor wild organisms as wood does.

        <Literal>Characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous American hops, the American pale ale is a medium-bodied beer with low
to medium caramel, and carries with it a toasted maltiness. American pale ale is one of the most food-friendly styles to enjoy, since
the pale ale works wonderfully with lighter fare such as salads and chicken, but can still stand up to a hearty bowl of chili; a variety
of different cheeses, including cheddar; seafood, like steamed clams or fish, and even desserts. The American pale aleâs affinity to
food can be attributed to the simplicity of its ingredients, which include toasty pale malt, a clean fermenting ale beer yeast, and the
counterbalance of American hops to help tease out the flavor or cleanse the palate, preparing you for another bite.

The Irish-style red ale is a balanced beer that uses a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley in the recipe, which gives
the beer the color for which it is named. Featuring an approachable hop bitterness which rests on the palate, this typically ambercolored beer is brewed as a lager or an ale, and can often have a medium, candy-like caramel malt sweetness. This style may
contain adjuncts such as corn, rice, and sugar, which help dry out the beerâs finish and lessen the body. It also often contains
roasted barley, lending low roasted notes, darker color and possible creation of a tan collar of foam on top. With notes of caramel,
toffee and sometimes low-level diacetyl (butter), think of the Irish red ale beer style as a cousin to lightly-toasted and buttered
bread.

examples of these styles do exist. Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Schwarzbier, or black beer, is a dark lager that originated in Germany. They tend to have an opaque, black colour with hints of chocolate or coffee flavours, and are generally around 5% ABV. They are similar to stout in that they are made from roasted malt, which gives them their dark colour.

&quot;Scotch ale&quot; was first used as a designation for strong ales exported from Edinburgh in the 18th century.[32] The term has become popular in the US, where strong ales which may be available in Scotland under a different name are sold in America as &quot;Scotch ales&quot;.

Session beer is not defined by flavors or aromas, which can place it in almost any style category. Instead, what makes a session
beer is primarily refreshment and drinkability. Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style
guidelines. The goal should be to reach a balance between the styleâs character and the lower alcohol content. Drinkability is a
factor in the overall balance of these beers. Beer should not exceed 5 percent ABV.

Additional notes: This category includes beers of any style that 1) are at or below 5.0% abv (4.0% abw), and 2) have an original gravity and alcohol content below the range of the classic style as defined in these guidelines. These beers exhibit lower original gravity and alcohol content than the classic style. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. Beers at or below 5.0% abv (4% abw) that adhere to the specifications of a classic style are not categorized as Session Beers. For example, low gravity beers such as Belgian-Style Table Beers, Belgian-Style Session Ales or English-Style Mild Ales should be categorized within their appropriate categories. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to further subcategorize this category. Competition organizers may request that brewers

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and flavors should be present at low levels.
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: None to high
Perceived bitterness: None to high
Fermentation Characteristics: Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS and Brettanomyces should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. There should be no residual flavors from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin should not be present.
Body: Low to high
Additional notes: Beers exhibiting wood-derived characters or characters of liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Fruited versions are categorized elsewhere.

Clarity: Clear to hazy is acceptable
Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending on intention of brewer
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to very high
Perceived bitterness: Very low to very high
Fermentation Characteristics: Specialty Beers are brewed with atypical fermentable sugars, grains and/or starches which contribute to alcohol content. The hallmark of Specialty Beers are the distinctive attributes of these special ingredients, which should be present in the aroma, flavor and overall balance of the beer. Examples could include maple syrup, agave, potatoes, wild rice, or any other sources of carbohydrate not commonly used in modern beer styles. Beers containing wheat are categorized in one of several wheat beer styles. The use of rice or corn would not normally be considered unusual since these adjuncts are commonly used in beer production. However, beers made with rice or corn varieties which imbue highly distinctive flavor attributes might be categorized as Specialty Beers.
Body: Varies with underlying style
Additional notes: Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers made with unusual fermentables, which also contain spices, fruits, or other ingredients and which therefore represent a combination of two or more hybrid beer styles are categorized as Experimental Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart much more flavor than fermentables, and beers containing nuts are categorized as Field Beers. Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable and beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beers. Beers brewed with honey are categorized as Specialty Honey Beers. Beers brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. which exhibit herbal and/or spicy characters are categorized as Herb and Spice Beers. While beers brewed with fruits or vegetables may derive fermentable carbohydrate from those sources, they are most appropriately categorized within various Fruit Beer or Field Beer categories.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of unusual carbohydrate source used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

        <IRI>#Weizenbock</IRI>
        <Literal>German-Style Weizenbock

The German-style Weizenbock is a wheat version of a German-style bock, or a bigger and beefier dunkelweizen. Malt mellanoidins
and weizen ale yeast are the star ingredients. If served with yeast, the appearance may appropriately be very cloudy. With flavors of
bready malt and dark fruits like plum, raisin, and grape, this style is low on bitterness and high on carbonation. Balanced clovelike phenols and fruity, banana-like esters produce a well-rounded aroma.

Hop Aroma/Flavor Hop aroma is not perceived. Hop bitterness is low
Common Hop Ingredients German Noble
Malt Aroma/Flavor Nutmeg, vanilla, caramel, plums, prunes, raisins, grapes and cocoa, with rum
and brandy flavors to boot. Medium malty sweetness is present. If dark, a mild
roasted malt aroma and flavor should emerge
Common Malt Ingredients Malted Wheat, Munich, Special &quot;B&quot;, Crystal, Pale Chocolate
Palate Body Moderate to Mouth-Coating
Palate Carbonation Medium

Typically lighter in appearance, wheat beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast, and American wheat beer can be brewed
with at least 30 percent malted wheat. Like the traditional German hefeweizen, these beers are typically served unfiltered and can
have a cloudy appearance when roused. Traditionally hoppier than its German cousin, American wheat beer differs in that it does
not offer flavors of banana or clove, which is indicative of the weizen yeast strain. Nevertheless, the American wheat beer is known
worldwide as a refreshing summer style.

Color: Generally straw to light amber, and often influenced by the color of added fruit.
Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable. These beers may be served with or without yeast. When served with yeast, appearance is hazy to very cloudy.
Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium-low
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium
Perceived bitterness: Low to medium
Fermentation Characteristics: These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast depending on the underlying wheat beer style. Low fruity esters are typical. Diacetyl should not be present. In versions served with yeast, yeasty aroma and flavor should be low to medium.
Body: Low to medium
Additional notes: The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute aroma and flavor expressing true fruit complexity. Versions served with yeast should demonstrate a full yeasty mouthfeel. Fruited examples of wheat beer styles that are not commonly brewed with fruit and do not exhibit attributes of wood aging should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. These could include fruited versions of various wheat beer styles of European origin such as Weizens, Adambier or Grodziskie.
Fruited wheat beers that exhibit sourness fall within various fruited sour beer categories. Such beers could deviate from parameters shown for those styles but should be suggestive of the underlying classic beer style with fruit added. Fruited versions of Berliner Weisse or Contemporary Gose fall within those categories as they are commonly brewed with fruit. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be entered as Field Beers.
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes.

        <Literal xml:lang="en">&quot;whisky ale&quot; is a designation used by brewers in France for peat-smoked malt flavoured beers.[37] This style is distinct from the Scotch ales, having a translucent amber, rather than opaque brown, appearance, and a smoky rather than sweet taste. Even though the malt used by brewers in Scotland is not generally or traditionally dried by peat burning, some Scottish whisky distilleries have used low nitrogen barley dried by peat burning. The distinctive flavour of these smoked malts is reminiscent of whisky, and some peat smoke flavour is added during malting by an additional process.

Color: Any color is acceptable. Versions made with fruits or other flavorings may take on corresponding hues.
Clarity: Clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze.
Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Generally, these beers are highly attenuated resulting in very low to low malt character. Maltier versions should display good overall balance with other flavor components.
Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to high
Perceived bitterness: Very low to low
Fermentation Characteristics: Aromas may vary significantly due to fermentation attributes contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Wild beers are spontaneously fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment near the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild Beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild Beers may or may not be perceived as acidic. They may include a highly-variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived
from the wild microorganisms with which they are fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body are important factors in assessing these beers.
Body: Very low to medium
Additional notes: Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients should be categorized as Wild Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, beers which hew to classic or traditional categories such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be categorized as such, rather than as Wild Beers.

Belgian-style witbier is brewed using unmalted wheat, sometimes oats and malted barley. Witbiers are spiced with coriander and
orange peel. A style that dates back hundreds of years, it fell into relative obscurity until it was revived by Belgian brewer Pierre
Celis in the 1960s. This style is currently enjoying a renaissance, especially in the American market. âWitâ means âwhite.â

        <Literal xml:lang="en">Witbier, white beer, biÃ¨re blanche, or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins, which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from medieval beers that were flavored and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants, such as coriander, orange, and bitter orange referred to as &quot;gruit&quot; instead of using hops.

        <Literal>Barrel-Aged Beer

A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, that has been
aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the unique
character of the wood and/or the flavor of what has previously been in the barrel. Todayâs craft brewers are using wood (mostly
oak) to influence flavor and aromatics. Beer may be aged in wooden barrels (new or previously used to age wine or spirits), or
chips, spirals and cubes may be added to the conditioning tanks that normally house beer. A variety of types of wood are used
including oak, apple, alder, hickory and more. The interior of most barrels is charred or toasted to further enhance the flavor of the
wood.

Additional notes: These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. These beers are aged with the intention of
developing unique attributes imparted by the wood and/or liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors, but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. Wood-Aged Beers may or may not have Brettanomyces character.
